# GA Press Release

Your job is to take this GA Press Release and turn it into an HTML page!

- Finish marking up the page (using things like h1, h2, p, ol or ul, li and a)
- As a bonus, add an image to the page (a GA logo)
- As a bonus, turn each list item into a link to the relevant campus
- Create an external stylesheet, and link it up to the GA Press Release
  - Change things like the background colour, colour of the text, add a border around the whole page, and anything else you want to do
